### How it started
this started on july 25 2022, me and some other devs who i work with decided to make a app for the ps3 that will let u play any ps3 game online even if the servers are dead we are curently working on this and its gonna take some time until its released we already started building the application we have put a to-do list down here:

- [ ] make actual working servers
- [ ] build an apllication for the ps3
- [ ] rebuild psn services
- [ ] rebuild Rockstar services
- [ ] rebuild lbp servers
- [ ] finish it before the end of 2023

### Whats going on now?
at the moment we are developing this project and living our own life if u want to help with this project then join the discord and we will tell u how u can help.

so one day after the begining i uploaded a locked version that u cant open and it will say that its corrupted but its private!
